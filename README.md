# notify-dinner
A microservice that sends me push notifications on what's for dinner today

I'm very lazy. I also happen to hate the question, "What's for dinner today?"
I don't want hear about it OR spend precious brain cycles having to think about it

Behold! I will innovate to perpertrate this laziness.
